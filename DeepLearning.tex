The idea of making computers think like human belongs to 50s and even before. But due to algorithmic and hardware shortages always this  attempt was a failure. But in recent years algorithms that act like human starts to get fantastic results. The group of algorithms that imitate human brain called Deep Learning. Deep Learning is mainly based on huge Artificial Neural Networks that tries to find deeper relations inside input data and tries to extract a meaning of input data.
\section{Artificial Neural Network}
Artificial Neural Network was a shallow copy of human neural system. It is constructed from nodes like human neurons that is placed into three main different kinds of layers. First layer that reads data called input, hidden layer that is itself is at least one layer (in Deep Learning this hidden layer composed of more hidden layers) and another layer that is called output layer. \\
The first researches over ANNs was done in 50s but training it, was always a big problem and different methods proposed but none of them was really successful until Backward Propagation(BP). It was the time that Neural Networks become a hot topic in Machine Learning researches again.\\
